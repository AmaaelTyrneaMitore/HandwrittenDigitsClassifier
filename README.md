# 🤖 Handwritten Digits Classifier 📝

This project aims to build a Handwritten Digits Classifier using TensorFlow.js and Node.js. The model identifies digits (0-9) from the famous MNIST dataset, serving as an excellent introduction to machine learning concepts.

## Features

- 🔍 Train and evaluate a multinomial logistic regression model
- 📊 Analyze model performance metrics and accuracy
- 🧠 Experiment with different model architectures
- 📈 Visualize the cost history of the model

## Usage

1. **💻 Clone the repo**: `git clone git@github.com:AmaaelTyrneaMitore/HandwrittenDigitsClassifier.git`
2. **⚙ Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **🚀 Launch the project**: `npm start`
4. **🧪 Launch the project with nodemon**: `npm run start:dev`
5. **You will find the cost history visualizaiton in `cost_history.png` in the project root**
